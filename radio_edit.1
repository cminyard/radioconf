.TH yaesu_edit 1 11/30/09 Yaesu "Yaesu radio config editing program"

.SH NAME
yaesu_config \- A program to edit clone information for Yaesu radios

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B yaesu_edit 
[\fIoptions\fR]
[<filename> ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR yaesu_edit
program allows a user to edit cloned data from Yaesu radios.  This
allows a user to more easily configure the radio, as the limited
user interfaces on radios often make them difficult to program.

a program exists to modify the information, then the information can be
extracted from the radio using yaesu_rw, modified, then written back
using yaesu_rw.

This may not support all Yaesu radios.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-configdir\fR \fIdirectory\fR
Use the given directory for the radio configuration instead of the default
location.

.SH "USAGE"
To use this program, you generally transfer the configuration from a
radio to the computer using
.B yaesu_rw
then edit the file with:
.IP
yaesu_edit radio_file
.PP
and make any changes you desire.  Then you may write the data back
using
.B yaesu_rw.

To restore your data, again put the radio in clone mode, do
.IP
yaesu_rw -h -w radio_file
.PP
This will put a prompt up.  Put your radio into clone RX mode, then press
enter on the screen to start the transmission to the radio.

.SH "CUTTING AND PASTING"
Cutting and pasting is the easiest way to move memories around.  You
should be able to cut and paste arbitrarily large sets of memories.
Overlapping cut and paste may or may not be a problem.  If it causes
issues, it may be best to create an empty file to use as a temporary
repository.

Not that you can cut and paste memories between different types of
radios, any feature that is compatible should transfer.

.SH "AUTO REPEATER OFFSETS"
The program will attempt to automatically determine the country you are
in and set the repeater offsets appropriately.  This requires that someone
has entered repeater offsets for your country/region and that the program
can determine the country properly.

You can override the country for the program by changing the
.B LANG
environment variable.  For instance, the author's
.B LANG
variable is en_US.UTF8, so the language is English, the country is the
US, and the default encoding is UTF8.  If he wanted to use British
repeater offsets, he would do:
.IP
LANG=en_GB.UTF8 yaesu_edit myfile.mem
.PP

.SH "NOTES"
It's pretty straightforward to use this.  A few notes:

For passwords, DTMF digits, and other hex strings, a space character
marks the end of the string, at least in some radios.  So don't put
space in these, except at the end.

.SH "ADDING YOUR RADIO"
The first thing to do is add the radio to the radios file as described
in the 
.B yaesu_rw
man page.  Once you can transfer files back and forth, then you can
start decoding your radio.  Basically, you change something, transfer the
configuration, then use hexdump and diff or something similar to see what
changed.  This sucks, but unless you can get the info from Yaesu, you
are stuck with this method.
.P
Note that if you have ADMS, you can use it to change things and transfer
the file over as described in the
.b yaesu_rw
man page.  This is a lot easier than using the radio, generally.
.P
You should record your information in a layout file like the ones that
are already in the source configuration.
.P
Once you have figured out the layout, you can work on the radio files.  The
.b RAD_FILES
file in the configuration directory describes the file format.
.P
Note that you might have to add some built-in types.
.P
Will this work with your radio?  I don't know how.  I've made it work with
the ones I have.  See the FAQ for more details.

.SH "SEE ALSO"
.B yaesu_rw.1

.BR /etc/yaesuconf/RAD_FILES
has the description of the various configuration files.

.SH "KNOWN PROBLEMS"
Still lots of things needed to be added.
