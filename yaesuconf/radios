#
# This is a configuration file for yaesu_rw, for configuring the parameters
# for various radios.  This defines a header, filesize, blocks, etc. for
# a radio.
#
# Each radio is surrounded by "radio <name>" and "endradio".
#
# The thing between those are "name" "value".  The valid parameters are:
#
#  headercmp <header data>
#    The header data is a set of hex characters that is the first set
#    of data sent/received by the radio.  This is only the data that is
#    used to compare.
#
#  headerlen <size> (optional)
#    The size of the header, only required if the header has some variable
#    stuff (version#, etc) that is not important and may change though
#    the format is the same.
#
#  filesize  <size>
#    The total size of the data transferred by the radio, including the
#    header.
#
#  blocksize <size>
#    The size of a block.  This is only used if all the blocks are the
#    same size for a radio.  Otherwise, use blocksizelist.
#
#  blocksizelist (c, s) [(c, s) ....]
#    For radios that have variable block sizes, this is the list of
#    block sizes.  It's a list of value pairs where each value pair is in ().
#    The first is the number of value of the size to be sent.  The second
#    is the size of the block.  The blocksize of the last pair is used for
#    all blocks after it.  For instance, if the first block is 20 bytes,
#    the 2nd-10th block is 50 bytes, and the last 5 blocks are 10 byte,
#    You could use: (1, 20) (9, 50) (0, 10).
#    Notice that the count in the last field is not used, since it's used
#    for all succeeeding blocks.
#
#  checksum | nochecksum (optional)
#    Sets whether the radio send/receives a checksum.  Defaults to nochecksum.
#    A checksum is a single byte at the end of the data that is the modulo-256
#    sum of all the other bytes in the data.  Note that the checksum is not
#    part of the filesize, so if a checksum is present, the filesize will be
#    one less than the total data sent.
#
#  checkblock | nocheckblock (optional)
#    Sets whether the radio send/receives a checkblock.  In this mode,
#    the first byte of a block is the block number (starting with 1,
#    and the header is not included) and the last byte of a block is
#    a checksum.  Note that these two values are not stored in the file
#    when it is saved.  Defaults to nocheckblock.
