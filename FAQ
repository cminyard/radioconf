Will this work with my radio?

  I have no idea.  I have an FT-60, and FT-7800, and an FT-897, so
  I've made it work with those.  Other people may make it work with
  their radios, or it may just work.  If so, I will take changes
  and reports of working/nonworking radios.


Will you make it work with my radio?

  Well, that depends.  If you follow the instructions in the man page,
  you may be able to get it to work.  But there may be issues.

  I'm not going to buy a radio or go back and forth with you forever
  to get something working.  I'll try a few simple things, perhaps,
  but not much.  If you are willing to give me a radio or pay me
  enough to buy a radio, that's another story, I *might* do it
  depending on my status.  But it's difficult to support something if
  you don't have the hardware.

  You, of course, can do the work.  Or you might ask on a list;
  someone else with the radio and Linux may be interested in doing
  this.  I'll gladly take patches as long as they are reasonable.  I
  would expect you to maintain the work and test it periodically, or
  the device will go unsupported.


Are you adding the ability to modify the configuration?

  That's my plan, but that's a bigger job than just cloning.
  Hopefully soon.


When that happens, will you support my radio for configuration?

  See the previous response, but I will not support this without
  hardware, and even then it's a very long process.  Yaesu will not
  release the information, so it has to be reverse-engineered.
  Money, of course makes things easier.  Not that I'm doing this
  software for money, but that's really what it will take.

  Of course, as before, you can do the work or you may be able to find
  someone else.  But reverse-engineering just sucks.
