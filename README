This is yaesu_conf, software for configuring Yaesu radios.  It consists
of two programs: yaesu_rw and yaesu_edit.


yaesu_rw
--------

The yaesu_rw program for using the clone mode of Yaesu radios to back
up and restore radio configuration.


kenwood_rw
--------

The kenwood_rw program for using the serial port to a Kenwood TM-V71
to back up and restore radio configuration.


radio_edit
----------

The radio_edit program lets you edit the configuration of the radios.
It can generally edit all the memories of the radio along with a lot
of the menu configuration.  It does not transfer the data, you have to
use yaesu_rw independently to get the configuration from the radio and
write it back out after you edit it.


Layout files
------------

The "xxx.layout" files here are attempts to decode the cloned
information into the meanings of the various data fields.

The eventual goal is to have a program that allows the user to modify
the contents of a cloned file to make it easier to program the
monstrous number of memory that some of these radios have.


Supported radios
----------------

This software has been tested with the following radios:

Yaesu

  FT-60R       works
  FT-7800R     works
  FT-897D      works
  VX-7R        works

Kenwood

  TM-V71       works

Jim Tittsler wrote a program named vxu that did the same thing as
yaesu_rw, but I had stability problems with it, as the timing method
he was using caused glitching on on of my serial port.  So I rewrote
using, IMHO, a better method for using this.
