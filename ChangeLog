	* yaesuconf/RAD_FILES: Document the changes.

	* yaesu_edit.py.in, yaesuconf/FT-857D.rad: There were strange
	bit settings required in the 857, so I had to add a bunch of
	code to account for that.

	* yaesu_edit.py.in, yaesuconf/*.rad: Added proper tone and
	frequency cutting and pasting to enable cutting and pasting
	between the various radio types.

	* yaesu_edit.py.in: Fix pasting of frequencies to write to offsets
	if they are present, and clean up the whole cut/paste thing to use
	handlers so ties work properly.

	* yaesuconf/FT-60R.rad, yaesuconf/FT-7800R.rad: Add cutpaste=False
	to all the offset tabs.

	* yaesu_edit.py.in: Fix a problem with large selections
