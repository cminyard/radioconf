	* yaesuconf/Makefile.am: Install the VX-7R files.

	* yaesu_rw.c: Get --chunksize and --waitchunk working.

	* yaesu_rw.c: Add a delayack setting, and don't send the ack twice
	if we are delaying the ack.

	* yaesu_edit.py.in: Fix a cut-paste problem.  For the VX-7R, don't
	paste into the TxFreq values unless it's in split mode.  For the
	VX-7R and FT-60, inform the offset freq of a change from TxFreq
	if the offset freq is not an enum.  cutpaste wouldn't work because
	they are all cutpaste.

	* yaesuconf/radios: Add nodelayack for VX-7R.

	* yaesuconf/VX-7R.rad: Fix the enable settings for memories.

	* Makefile.am: Fix a script problem, use -eq, not == to compare
	numbers.

2010-07-31  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	* yaesu_edit.py.in: Fix a problem with the input of numerical
	data.  It would give errors on inputting bad data.  It now turns
	the value red if the value is invalid.

	* yaesuconf/FT-857D.rad: Add separate RF power level for HF, 50MHz
	144MHz, and 440MHz, since they are individually settable.

	* yaesu_rw.c: Added a short delay before sending the last ack to
	the radios.  Some radios would give an error if the last ack came
	too fast.

	* ChangeLog: Move to version 0.9 for release.

2010-07-25  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	* yaesu_edit.py.in: Added a Hex type (for holding the RGB values
	in the VX-7R color handling), added a 16-bit string for handling
	the CW ID on the VX-7R, and fixed some more cut/paste issues.

	* layouts/VX-7R.layout: Found a few more things and finished out
	what I needed to support the useful config in the VX-7R.

	* yaesuconf/VX-7R.rad: Add all the config and fix some problems
	in the memory layout.

	* yaesuconf/FT-60R.rad, yaesuconf/FT-7800R.rad: Fix some cut/paste
	issues, don't cut/paste the transmit offset, just the transmit
	frequency.  If we do a radio that doesn't have a transmit frequency,
	just an offset, we will need to pull the transmit frequency from
	the stream and calculate the offset.  Not a big deal, really.

	* README, FAQ, yaesu_rw.1: Worked some on the documentation.

2010-07-24  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	* yaesu_rw.c, yaesu_rw.1: Added some options to allow chunksize
	sending with delay between the chunks and different handling of
	the sent checksum to support the VX-7R.

	* yaesuconf/radios: Added the VX-7R.

	* yaesu_edit.py.in, yaesucon/RAD_FILES: Added the BCDFixedFreq,
	YaesuLCString, and BCDFreq2 types for supporting the VX-7R.

	* yaesuconf/VX-7R.empty, yaesuconf/VX-7R.rad, layouts/VX-7R.layout:
	Begin work on the VX-7R.

2010-02-17  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	* yaesu_edit.py.in: Ignore a typed '.' in the BCDFreq widget.

	* yaesu_edit.py.in: Allow tabs to go through in the fixed widget

	* yaesu_edit.py.in: Fix repeater offset handling for the BCDFreq
	widget.

2009-12-12  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	* yaesu_edit.py.in: Fix a problem with reverse checkboxes that
	was causing trouble with the FT-857.

	* configure.in: Move to version 0.8.

2009-11-30  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	* yaesuconf/RAD_FILES, yaesu_edit.1: Added some more documentation
	for the new features, cleaned things up a little.

	* configure.in: Move to version 0.7.

2009-11-27  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	* yaesu_edit.py.in: Added some docs, fixed path joining to use
	the proper python operations.

	* yaesu_edit.py.in: Add the ability to do automatic repeater
	offsets based upon the typed-in frequency.

	* yaesuconf/FT-857D.rad: Fix an offset link problem.

	* yaesuconf/US.rpt: Add US repeater offsets.

	* yaesuconf/FT-857.mem: Clean up the "empty" file for this radio.

2009-11-26  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	* yaesu_edit.py.in: Clean up the startup and shutdown to properly
	handle multiple files, closing only one window when one is closed,
	print out decent errors on invalid files, and fix a problem where
	the data will be modified.

	* yaesu_edit.py.in: Rename BuiltIn to YType.

	* yaesu_edit.py.in, FT-857D.layout, yaesuconf/RAD_FILES,
	yaesuconf/FT-857.rad: Renamed "Dummy" to "Special".

	* *.layout, layouts/Makefile.am, Makefile.am, configure.in: Move
	layout files to their own directory.

	* yaesu_edit.py.in: Remove some unused code.

	* yaesuconf/RAD_FILES: Clean up the docs a little.

	* yaesu_edit.py.in: When creating a new file, make sure it
	doesn't save back to the empty file automatically.

	* yaesu_edit.py.in: Fix some selection problems.

	* yaesu_edit.py.in: Fix BCDFreq to properly handle 2.5kHz steps.

2009-11-22  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	* yaesu_edit.py.in: Fix a pasting problem with checkboxes and
	some select/paste problems.

	* configure.in: Move to version 0.6.

2009-11-21  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	* yaesuconf/RAD_FILES: Document the changes.

	* yaesu_edit.py.in, yaesuconf/FT-857D.rad: There were strange
	bit settings required in the 857, so I had to add a bunch of
	code to account for that.

	* yaesu_edit.py.in, yaesuconf/*.rad: Added proper tone and
	frequency cutting and pasting to enable cutting and pasting
	between the various radio types.

	* yaesu_edit.py.in: Fix pasting of frequencies to write to offsets
	if they are present, and clean up the whole cut/paste thing to use
	handlers so ties work properly.

	* yaesuconf/FT-60R.rad, yaesuconf/FT-7800R.rad: Add cutpaste=False
	to all the offset tabs.

	* yaesu_edit.py.in: Fix a problem with large selections

2009-11-20  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

2009-11-13  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	* Lots of work on the FT-7800R editing, mostly finished at
	this point.

2009-11-11  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	* Added licenses to the files, fixed a few problems for the
	857 cloning, started work on the 857 description file.

2009-11-10  Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>

	editor.  Release version 0.2.
