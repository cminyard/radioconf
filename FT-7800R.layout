Memory bank# is broken in ADMS, need to get from radio



This uses the same base protocol as the FT-60R.

The frequency definition is the same as the FT-60R.

Memories are in a similar 16-byte format as the FT-60R, all fields appear to
be the same, but some semantics are different, and the menus are different.

Memories take up 16 bytes in the format:
	    byte 0 bits 0-2 - repeater offset direction (menu 33):
		              0 - simplex
			      1 - ?
			      2 - minus
			      3 - plus
			      4 - split (transmit frequency valid)
		   bit 3 - ?
		   bit 4 - 0=FM, 1=AM (menu 35, see byte c bit 1 on "main"
			configuration for details on this)
		   bit 5 - TX Narrow (menu 47):  0=Wide, 1=Narrow
		   bit 7 - 1 to enable and 0 to disable a channel
	    byte 1 - byte 3 - Receive frequency
	    byte 4 bits 0-2 - Tone mode (menu 42) (see table)
		   bits 4-6 - Step (see note below) (see table)
		   bit 7 - Clock shift (menu 6)
	    byte 5 - byte 7 - transmit frequency
	    byte 8 bits 0-5 - CTCSS tone (menu 44)
	           bits 6-7 - Transmit power (see table)
	    byte 9 - DCS code (menu 9)
	    byte 10 - unknown, always 0f.  Note, on the main memory, bit 7
		seems to get set with wide/narry in byte 0.  (FIXME - is
		the last statement true for the FT-7800?)
	    byte 11-12 - Shift (Offset frequency), only valid with minus
		 or plus offset) (menu 39)
	    byte 13-15 - unknown, always 00

There is not a "STEP" setting outside of frequencies, only
auto-step mode.  So if you set the step to non-auto and
non-default, power off, power on, the step will be set back
to the default.  It is only "saved" when written to a memory.

Transmit power
	0 - High (50/40w)
	1 - Mid1 (20w)
	2 - Mid2 (10w)
	3 - Low  (5w)

There is a common 16-byte configuration area shared among the hypermemories,
main configuration, and home memory.  It has the format:

	0 - bit 0-1 - Mode: 0=VFO, 1=Home, 2=Memory
	1 - bits 0-3 - DTMF Memory: 0=1, 1=2, etc.
	5 - bits 0-2 - Band: 0=144MHz, 1=250MHz, 2=350MHz, 4=430MHz, 5=800MHz
	6 - Menu#
	7 - VFO scan mode 0=Band, 1=+/-1MHz, 2=+/-2MHz, 3=+/-5MHz, 4=All,
		5=PMS-01, 6=PMS-02, ..., 54=PMS50 (1/2 Sec SCAN(SEL))
	8 - bits 0-3 - Wx Channel#: 0=1, 1=2, ..., 9=10
 	b - bit 7 - Wx Alert (menu 48)
	c - bit 0 - Auto Step Mode (menu 43, sort of)
	    bit 1 - Auto Receive Mode (menu 35)
	    bit 2 - VFO Band Edge Limiting (menu 46)
	    bit 4 - Packet Mic (menu 25)
	    bit 5 - Auto Repeater Split (menu 4)
	    bit 6 - Packet speed: 0=1200bps, 1=9600bps (menu 26)
	    
Hyperchannel information appears in 128-byte chunks in the form:

	00-49 - 5 VFO memories
	56-58 - Bitmask for bank links, Byte 56 bit 7 is bank1, byte 56 bit 6
		is bank2, etc, to byte 58 bit 4 is bank 20.  Byte 58 bits 0-3
		are not used.
	70-7f - common configuration data

0008-0018 - current display "memory", holds the current configuration.

0028-0037 - Main configuration area.  Note that ADMS sets this along with
	the area at 00c0 and hypermemory 1 whenever setting hypermemory 1
	settings, but I don't know what that means.

0048-00a7 - VFO (current) frequencies, in the memory format, though some fields
	    don't make sense.  The occur in the order: VHF, 250, 350, UHF
	    800.

00b8-00c7 - Home configuration area?  See note for location 0028.

00c8-01c8 - 16 sets of DTMF tones (menu 14), 16 values in each set,
	  where the value is the DTMF digit (0=0, 1=1, etc), taking the
	  whole byte.  0xff marks the end of the string.  First set is
	  set 1, 2nd set is set 2, etc.  Selected by byte 0042. (menu 14)

01c8-04c7 - 6 home/hypermemory configuration, each 128 bytes.  The first
	one is for home, the next for hypermemory1, etc.  Only the VFOs
	are used for the home memory.  See also note for location 0028.

*0240-0244 - CW ID (menu 8)

04c8-4340 - Memories in 16-byte format

4348-4987 - Limit memories, in the standard memory format, in the
	 order: L1, U1, L2, U2

4988-68c7 - Character strings for the 1000 memories, each 8 bytes.
	    The first 6 bytes is the characters, the last 2 bytes
	    has an unknown format, but appears to be 00 00 if the
	    data is not valid and 00 80 if the data is valid but the.
	    frequency is displayed and 80 80 if the data is valid and 
	    the name is displayed.  So byte 6 bit 7 is the alpha/freq bit
	    and byte 7 bit 7 is the "data valid" bit.
	    Memory 000 is at 6638. (menu 24)

68c8-6be7 - Character strings for the 100 limit memories, same format
	as the ones immediately above. (menu 24)

6c08-6c3f - Character strings for the Home memories, same format as
	  the ones above. (menu 24)

6c48-7647 - Bank settings.  Each of these is 128 bytes holding 1000 bit
	    entries for each bank.  So bank 1 start at 6c48, bank 2 starts
	    at 6cc8, etc.  Memories settings are, unfortunately, backwards
	    from the FT-60R.  Byte 0 bit 7 is memory 1, byte 0 bit 6, is
	    memory 2, etc, Byte 1 bit 7 is memory 9, and so on.  There are
	    20 banks.

7648-7741 - This is 1000 2-bit values holding the Skip field, starting
	    from high-order bits and going to low, which is unfortunately
	    backwards from the FT-60R.  So 7648 bits 6-7 are channel 1,
	    7648 bits 4-5 are channel 2, 7649 bits 6-7 are channel 4, etc.
	    (menu 40) The values are:
		0 - off
		1 - Skip
		2 - P Scan
