This uses the same base protocol as the FT-60R.

The frequency definition is the same as the FT-60R.

Memories are in the same 16-byte format as the FT-60R, all fields appear to
be the same

Transmit power
	0 - High (50/40w)
	1 - Mid1 (20w)
	2 - Mid2 (10w)
	3 - Low  (5w)

Hyperchannel information appears in 128-byte chunks in the form:

	00-49 - 5 VFO memories
	56-58 - Bitmask for bank links, Byte 56 bit 7 is bank1, byte 56 bit 6
		is bank2, etc, to byte 58 bit 4 is bank 20.  Byte 58 bits 0-3
		are not used.
	70 - bit 0-1 - Mode: 0=VFO, 1=Home, 2=Memory
	71 - bits 0-3 - DTMF Memory: 0=1, 1=2, etc.
	75 - bits 0-2 - Band 0=144MHz, 1=250MHz, 2=350MHz, 4=430MHz, 5=800MHz
	76 - Menu#
	77 - VFO scan mode 0=Band, 1=+/-1MHz, 2=+/-2MHz, 3=+/-5MHz, 4=All,
		5=PMS-01, 6=PMS-02, ..., 54=PMS50
	78 - bits 0-3 - Wx Channel#: 0=1, 1=2, ..., 9=10
 	7b - bit 7 - Wx Alert
	7c - bit 0 - Auto Step Mode
	     bit 1 - Auto Receive Mode
	     bit 2 - VFO Band Edge
	     bit 4 - Packet Mic
	     bit 5 - Auto Repeater Split
	     bit 6 - Packet speed: 0=1200bps, 1=9600bps
	    
	Notes: Memory bank# is broken in ADMS, need to get from radio


003a -	*bits 0-4 - Auto power off (menu 1):
		off = v * (.5 hours) up to 12 hours.

003c -	*bit 4 - ARTS polling interval (menu ?): 0=25sec, 1=15sec
	*bits 5-7 - Lock type (menu ??): 0=off, 1=Key, 2=Dial, 3=Key+Dial,
		4=PTT, 5=PTT+Key, 6=PTT+Dial, 7=All

0042 -	*bits 0-3 - Internet DTMF Digit:  0=Code0, 1=Code1, ..., 9=Code9
	*bits 4-7 - Internet DTMF Memory:  0=D1, 1=D2, ..., f=D16

0043 -	*bits 0-1 - Dimmer: 0=Off, 1=Dim1, 2=Dim2, 3=Dim3
	*bit 2 - Memory Only
	*bits 3-4 - Hyper write: 0=Manual, 2=1-Auto, 1=Auto
	*bit 7 - ARTS CW ID

0044 -	*bit3 - Internet mode: 0=Code, 1=Memory
	*bit 5 - Key beep, must be set to set Scan beep, see bit 7
	*bit 6 - Band Edge Beep (menu 15)
	*bit 7 - Scan beep.  Key beep must be enabled to set this, see
		bit 5.

0045 -	*bit 4 - Priority Revert (menu ??)
	*bits 6-7 - DCS N/R, values are (menu ??): 0=T/RX N, 1=RX R,
		2=TX R, 3=T/RX R

0046 -	*bits 0-1 - ARTS Beep: 0=Off, 1=Always, 2=Inrange

0048-00a7 - VFO (current) frequencies, in the memory format, though some fields
	    don't make sense.  The occur in the order: VHF, 250, 350, UHF
	    800.

00c8-01c8 - 16 sets of DTMF tones (menu 14), 16 values in each set,
	  where the value is the DTMF digit (0=0, 1=1, etc), taking the
	  whole byte.  0xff marks the end of the string.  First set is
	  set 1, 2nd set is set 2, etc.  Selected by byte ???.

01c8-04c7 - 6 home/hypermemory configuration, each 128 bytes.  The first
	one is for home, the next for hypermemory1, etc.  Only the VFOs
	are used for the home memory.

*0240-0244 - CW ID

04c8-4340 - Memories in 16-byte format

4348-4987 - Limit memories, in the standard memory format, in the
	 order: L1, U1, L2, U2

4988-68c7 - Character strings for the 1000 memories, each 8 bytes.
	    The first 6 bytes is the characters, the last 2 bytes
	    has an unknown format, but appears to be 00 00 if the
	    data is not valid and 00 80 if the data is valid but the.
	    frequency is displayed and 80 80 if the data is valid and 
	    the name is displayed.  So byte 6 bit 7 is the alpha/freq bit
	    and byte 7 bit 7 is the "data valid" bit.
	    Memory 000 is at 6638.

68c8-6be7 - Character strings for the 100 limit memories, same format
	as the ones immediately above.

6c48-7647 - Bank settings.  Each of these is 128 bytes holding 1000 bit
	    entries for each bank.  So bank 1 start at 6c48, bank 2 starts
	    at 6cc8, etc.  Memories settings are, unfortunately, backwards
	    from the FT-60R.  Byte 0 bit 7 is memory 1, byte 0 bit 6, is
	    memory 2, etc, Byte 1 bit 7 is memory 9, and so on.  There are
	    20 banks.

7648-7741 - This is 1000 2-bit values holding the Skip field, starting
	    from high-order bits and going to low, which is unfortunately
	    backwards from the FT-60R.  So 7648 bits 6-7 are channel 1,
	    7648 bits 4-5 are channel 2, 7649 bits 6-7 are channel 4, etc.
	    (menu 40) The values are:
		0 - off
		1 - Skip
		2 - P Scan
